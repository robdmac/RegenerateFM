# FM Face to-do

## Requested (2026-10-15)

1. **Performance measurement.** Done (2026-10-15). FM Face's own work on
   FM24's UI thread is about 0.35 ms a minute when idle, and at most 4.4 ms
   for a single event (showing a dialog). The companion uses no CPU when idle
   and its memory reads don't pause the game. Each read takes about 4.3 s,
   mostly in Python's byte searches; since made faster (see "In progress").
   Details are in `fm24/native_menu/README.md`.
2. **Remove the remaining overlays.** Done (2026-10-15). FM24's progress,
   confirmations, results and errors are FM24 dialogs; squad rows come from
   the table's row model and the biography from the displayed widget. All X11
   code (overlays, `--direct-clicks`, screenshots/OCR, scrolling, the
   Preferences reload fallback) and zenity have been removed; the companion
   requires the native DLL.
3. **Compatibility check for macOS and Windows.** Done (2026-10-15); see
   "Platform support" in the README. The FM24 companion now has a Windows
   memory backend, checked with Windows Python under Wine against the live
   game; macOS is refused (FM24 for Mac is a native program the DLL cannot
   hook). Still to do: a run on real Windows, and FM26 on macOS if wanted
   (per-platform build pins and the community Il2CppInterop patch).

## In progress

- In-game squad generation: done (memory roster from the row model, portrait
  index, prompts by ID; a billed two-face batch with Stop passed). Memory
  reads were made faster on 2026-10-16 (Generate about 10 s to 3.4 s, squad
  8.5 s to 4.2 s). The "All Players" view now works: reserve and youth
  players are read, and the few undrawn players whose names FM24 hasn't
  loaded are left out with a note.

## Later

- **FM24 Update face:** grey the row out when there is no face. The skin popup
  has no per-row enabled state, so the DLL would have to change it when the
  popup opens.
- **FM24 Overview dropdown item:** add Generate and Update face to the player
  Overview dropdown (code-generated; needs DLL work like the Squad menu item).
- **FM26 Actions menu timing:** opened about 5 s after a profile loads, the
  menu can lack the FM Face items until it is reopened.
- **Release build:** rebuild the FM26 plugin in `hotreload/bin` (it predates
  Update face and the loan-club fix), then `make_release.py`.
- **Remote repo:** git is set up locally as FMFace; nothing has been pushed.
